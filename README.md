## About

`Timer` class makes it easy to execute code at some later moment of time. It is fast, performant and reliable.

## Installation

1. Add the dependency to your `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  timer:
    github: vladfaust/timer.cr
    version: ~> 0.1.0
```

2. Run `shards install`

This shard follows [Semantic Versioning v2.0.0](http://semver.org/), so check [releases](https://github.com/vladfaust/timer.cr/releases) and change the `version` accordingly. Note that until Crystal is officially released, this shard would be in beta state (`0.*.*`), with every **minor** release considered breaking. For example, `0.1.0` → `0.2.0` is breaking and `0.1.0` → `0.1.1` is not.

## Usage

Basic example:

```crystal
require "timer"

Timer.new(1.second) do
  puts "Triggered"
end

sleep # Will print "Triggered" after 1 second
```

Example with `select`:

```crystal
channel = Channel(Nil).new

select
when channel.receive
  puts "Never happens"
when Timer.new(1.second)
  puts "Timeout!"
end

sleep # Will print "Timeout!" after 1 second
```

You can `#postpone` and `#reschedule` a timer. The latter has bigger
performance impact if rescheduling at an earlier moment of time.

```
at = Time.utc + 5.minutes

timer = Timer.new(at) do
  puts "Triggered"
end

# OK, will trigger in 6 minutes from now
timer.postpone(1.minute)

# ditto
timer.reschedule(Time.utc + 6.minutes)

# Worse performance but still acceptable
timer.reschedule(Time.utc + 1.minute)
```

Note that a timer can be scheduled at a moment in the past, which means that it
would run immediately after given control by the Crystal scheduler.

You can also `#trigger` a timer (still calling the block in another fiber) or
`#cancel` it completely.

## Development

`crystal spec` and you're good to go.
